# My very first WordPress plugin

I was curious to learn how WordPress plugins interact with the rest of the code base.

This was just a test plugin, it outputs "Hello my name's Logan" in Russian at the top of every page. 

I do plan to revisit this topic and make a full-featured plugin in the future.
